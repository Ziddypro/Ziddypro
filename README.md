I like scratch programming a lot! Started coding
when i was 8, I started with scratch and this is helping
me a lot! I also learnt from other coding platforms like tynker.
I can code in some of the languages like python,html and css .
I learnt from online tutorials and watched
videos from other scratchers. My hobbies are playing
the keyboard (musical instrument) and playing sports such as football
basketball etc.
Coding on scratch really helps me and I feel good
scratching, so I work hard and try to get better on 
scratch and learn more new concepts to become an expert scratcher.
Currently I am learning data science topics in python.
